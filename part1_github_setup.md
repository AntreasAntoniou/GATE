**Intro to GitHub**

* **GitHub: A Cloud-Based Collaboration Platform** GitHub is a web-based platform that allows for version control and collaboration on code projects. It builds upon the power of Git, a powerful version control tool. 
* **Version Control (Simplified):**  Think of version control like a sophisticated "save" system for your code. It lets you track changes, revert to previous versions, and work in parallel branches without overwriting each other's work.
* **Why Use GitHub?**
    *   **Store and Share Code:** Securely host your projects and share them with the world.

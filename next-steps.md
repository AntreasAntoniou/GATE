For the GATE paper:

1. Image classification -> Done
2. Visual relational reasoning -> Done
3. Semantic segmentation
4. Few Shot Learning -> Working on it
5. Zero shot learning
6. Medical image classification
7. Medical semantic segmentation

8. Video classification
9. Text classification (models that support text modalities, CLIP, other multi-modal foundation models)
10. Audio classification -> as a modality shift (remove root, replace with new modality root embedding)


Premise is that we think, based on recent and past work, that we need a more

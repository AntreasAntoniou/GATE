**Hosting a Hugo Website on GitHub Pages**

**Prerequisites:**

*   **Basic Git knowledge:**  Understanding how to initialize a repository, commit changes, and push to a remote repository is helpful. If you're new to Git, check out a quick tutorial (there are many great ones online!)
*   **Installed Hugo:**  Make sure you have Hugo installed on your local machine. You can find installation instructions on the official Hugo website: [https://gohugo.io/](https://gohugo.io/)

**Steps:**

1.  **Create a New GitHub Repository:**
    *   After signing in to GitHub, click the "+" button in the top right corner and select "New repository."
    *   Name your repository with the following format: `username.github.io` (Replace 'username' with your actual GitHub username).
    *   Select "Public" for visibility.
    *   **Important:** Initialize the repository with a README file.

2.  **Set up Hugo Locally:**
    *   Open your terminal or command prompt.
    *   Create a new Hugo site: `hugo new site my-hugo-site` (replace 'my-hugo-site' with your desired site name).
    *   Navigate to your site's directory: `cd my-hugo-site` 
    *   Initialize a Git repository: `git init` 

3.  **Theme and Content:**
    *   Choose a Hugo theme you like from [https://themes.gohugo.io/](https://themes.gohugo.io/) and install it following the theme's instructions.
    *   Start creating content using Hugo commands (`hugo new posts/my-first-post.md`)

4.  **Link to GitHub:**
    *   Add your GitHub repository as a remote: `git remote add origin https://github.com/username/username.github.io.git`
    *   Make your initial commit: `git add .` and `git commit -m "Initial commit"`
    *   Push to GitHub: `git push -u origin main`  

5.  **Enable GitHub Pages:**
    *   In your repository, go to **Settings** -> **Pages**
    *   Under "Source," select the **main** branch and **root** folder.
    *   Click **Save**.

**It may take a few minutes for your site to go live. Your website will be accessible at `https://username.github.io`.**

**Additional Notes:**

*   Customize your Hugo site further by modifying the theme and adding your unique content.

*   Refer to the official Hugo documentation ([https://gohugo.io/](https://gohugo.io/)) and GitHub Pages documentation ([https://pages.github.com/](https://pages.github.com/)) for more detailed instructions and troubleshooting.

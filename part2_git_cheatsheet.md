**Basic Git Commands**

*   `git init`: Initialize a new Git repository in your project folder.
*   `git add .`: Stage all changes for a commit.
*   `git commit -m "Your commit message"`: Commit your changes with a descriptive message.
*   `git push origin main`: Push changes to your remote GitHub repository ('main' branch).
*   `git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git`: Clone an existing repository. 

**GitHub Workflow**

*   **Create a Repository:** On GitHub, start a new repository for your project.
*   **Connect Locally:** Link your local project to the GitHub repository using `git remote add`.
*   **Commit and Push:**  Work on your project, commit changes frequently, and push them to GitHub.
*   **Collaborate (Optional):** If collaborating, use branches, pull requests, and issues for streamlined teamwork.
